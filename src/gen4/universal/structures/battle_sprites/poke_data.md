# Sprite Poke_Data NARC
> This document was written by [turtleisaac](https://github.com/turtleisaac)

This NARC contains a single sub-file which contains one large table. This table contains, in no particular order:
* The values corresponding to the animations played when a Pok√©mon is sent out/ appears
  * This consists of two separate values, one for the front sprite and one for the back sprite.
* The size (or lack of) the shadow placed beneath front sprites of a species
* The X-Offset, measured in the number of pixels, of the shadow placed beneath front sprites of a species
* A "global" Y-Offset, measured in the number of pixels applied to all front sprites of a species.

## Data Location
The NARC containing these files can be found in the following game paths:
* Platinum: /poketool/poke_edit/pl_poke_data.narc
* HGSS: /a/1/8/0

Despite the fact that these are NARC files, don't let that trick you. All of the data is solely contained in one large, single sub-file within the NARC.

## Data Structure
This file consists of one huge table containing data for every single species. Each entry is 89 bytes long, so the number of entries can be found by dividing the size of the file by 89.

### Poke_Data NARC 0.bin
```c
// in an unmodified gen 4 game, NUM_SPECIES would equal 493.
// If you are using some sort of dex expansion mod such as Mikelan's HG dex expansion,
// hg-engine, or another one, then the number of entries can and will vary.

struct SpriteDataEntry spriteData[NUM_SPECIES];
```
| Field Name | Description                                | Data Type                           |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| spriteData | Custom types are linked under `Data Type`. | [SpriteDataEntry](#SpriteDataEntry) |

### SpriteDataEntry
```c
struct SpriteDataEntry
{
    /* 0x0 */ uint8_t unkByte;
    /* 0x1 */ uint8_t movement;
    /* 0x2 */ uint8_t unkSection1[42];
    /* 0x2C */ uint8_t backMovement;
    /* 0x2D */ uint8_t unkSection2[41];
    /* 0x56 */ int8_t frontYOffset;
    /* 0x57 */ int8_t shadowXOffset;
    /* 0x58 */ uint8_t shadowSize;
}; // entry size = 89 (0x59) bytes
```
