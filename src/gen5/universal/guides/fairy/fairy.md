# Fairy Type in B2W2
> This guide was written by [BluRose]() based significantly on research from [MeroMero]().

This is a tutorial that details how to insert the Fairy type in Black 2 and White 2 using MeroMero's initial research from years ago and building upon it with a new and improved better understanding of just what happens in the assembly.  While yet imperfect, the improvements allow for a much better Fairy representation overall, eliminating the appearance of glitched graphics and crashes overall.

## Graphics


### Type Icons - ``a082``, ``a125``


## Code - ASM File
I have made a [repository](https://github.com/BluRosie/b2w2-fairy) which should be downloaded as-is that has the fairy type code and is maintained as such.  Any additions or changes will be included there.

## TODO
- Type icon in the Dex does not show up--pure fairy types don't have anything show up!
- Hall of Fame palette loading--memory overflow or something?  Having it load nothing works fine, but appears as a black void.
- PC Screen tag overlap--fairy is loaded in the same sprite slot as one of the box icons and is both scrolled as such and the box icon doesn't show up in the menu.
